## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ci-runtime.yml` workflow for nightly + manual runtime inference tests, decoupled from release pipeline (#371)
- `APM_RUN_INFERENCE_TESTS` env var to gate live inference (`apm run`) in test scripts (#371)
- PR traceability `::notice` annotation in `ci-integration.yml` smoke-test job (#371)

### Changed

- Merged `test` + `build` into single `build-and-test` job across `ci.yml` and `build-release.yml` — eliminates ~1.5m runner re-provisioning per platform (#371)
- macOS consolidated jobs are now root nodes (no `needs: [test]`) — run own unit tests for full independence (#371)
- Removed `setup-node@v4` from unit test and build jobs that don't need Node.js (#371)
- Enabled native `setup-uv` caching (`enable-cache: true`), removed manual `actions/cache@v3` blocks (#371)
- Decoupled live inference tests (`apm run`) from release pipeline — reduces 14.9% false-negative rate and `GH_MODELS_PAT` secret exposure (#371)
- `ci-integration.yml` report-status now detects CI circular dependency (upstream failure) and reports `pending` instead of blocking (#371)
- `gh-aw-compat` is now informational (`continue-on-error: true`) — non-deterministic external dependencies should not block releases (#371)
- Copilot encoding instructions: `encoding.instructions.md` (`applyTo: "**"`) bans non-ASCII characters in source and CLI output; updated `copilot-instructions.md` and `cli.instructions.md` to use ASCII bracket notation (`[+]`/`[!]`/`[x]`/`[i]`/`[*]`/`[>]`) instead of emoji STATUS_SYMBOLS (#282)

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Centralized `AuthResolver` with per-(host, org) token resolution, cached and thread-safe — replaces 4 scattered auth implementations (#394)
- `CommandLogger` and `InstallLogger` base classes for structured CLI output with validation, resolution, and download phases (#394)
- `--verbose` flag on `uninstall`, `pack`, and `unpack` commands (#394)
- Verbose output: dependency tree resolution, auth source/type per download, lockfile SHA, package type, inline per-package diagnostics (#394)
- Parent chain breadcrumb in transitive dependency error messages — "root-pkg > mid-pkg > failing-dep" (#394)
- `DiagnosticCollector.count_for_package()` for inline per-package verbose hints (#394)
- Auth flow diagram and package source behavior matrix in authentication docs (#394)
- Documented `${input:...}` variable support in `headers` and `env` MCP server fields (#349)

### Changed

- All CLI output now uses ASCII symbols (`[+]`, `[x]`, `[!]`) instead of Unicode characters (#394)
- Migrated `_rich_*` calls to `CommandLogger` across install, compile, uninstall, audit, pack, and bundle modules (#394)
- Verbose ref display uses clean `#tag @sha` format instead of nested parentheses (#394)
- Integration tree lines (`└─`) no longer have `[i]` prefix — clean visual hierarchy (#394)
- Global env vars (`GITHUB_APM_PAT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`) apply to all hosts — HTTPS is the security boundary, not host-gating (#394)
- Credential-fill timeout increased from 5s to 60s (configurable via `APM_GIT_CREDENTIAL_TIMEOUT`, max 180s) — fixes Windows credential picker timeouts (#394)

### Fixed

- Bundle lockfile includes non-target `deployed_files` causing `apm unpack` verification failure when packing with `--target` (#394)
- Verbose lockfile iteration crashed with `'str' object has no attribute 'resolved_commit'` (#394)
- CodeQL incomplete URL substring sanitization in test assertions (#394)

### Security

- Bumped `h3` from 1.15.6 to 1.15.9 in docs (#400)

### Removed

- Unused image files: `copilot-banner.png`, `copilot-cli-screenshot.png` (#391)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Plugin authoring — `apm pack --format plugin` exports APM packages as standalone plugin directories (`plugin.json`, agents, skills, commands) consumable by Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and Cursor without APM installed (#379)
- `apm init --plugin` scaffolds a hybrid project with both `apm.yml` and `plugin.json`, including a `devDependencies` section (#379)
- `devDependencies` in `apm.yml` — dev deps install normally but are excluded from `apm pack` output; `apm install --dev` writes to the dev section (#379)
- VS Code runtime detection now falls back to `.vscode/` directory presence when the `code` binary is not on PATH — by @sergio-sisternes-epam (#359)

### Security

- Content integrity hashing — SHA-256 `content_hash` per dependency in `apm.lock.yaml`, verified on subsequent installs to detect tampering or force-pushed commits (#315, #379)
- `apm audit --strip` now preserves a leading BOM while stripping suspicious mid-file BOMs, preventing false negatives — by @dadavidtseng (#372)

### Changed

- Install URLs now use short `aka.ms/apm-unix` and `aka.ms/apm-windows` redirects across README, docs, and CLI output (#384)
- README highlights link to relevant docs pages; plugin authoring featured as a key value proposition (#385)

### Fixed

- `DependencyReference` preserved through the download pipeline so lockfile records the original ref, not an empty object — by @sergio-sisternes-epam (#383)
- Refactor command and model modules for readability and maintainability — by @sergio-sisternes-epam (#232)
- CLI docs align `compile --target opencode`, `audit --dry-run`, and planned `audit --drift` with current behavior (#373)

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- JFrog Artifactory VCS repository support — explicit FQDN, transparent proxy via `ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL`, and air-gapped `ARTIFACTORY_ONLY` mode (#354)
- GH-AW compatibility gate in release pipeline — `gh-aw-compat` job tests tokenless install + pack before publishing (#356)
- Release validation now includes `test_ghaw_compat` scenario (#356)

### Fixed

- Credential fill returning garbage token in tokenless CI environments — broke `apm install` for public repos in GitHub Actions (#356)

### Security

- Harden dependency path validation — reject invalid path segments at parse time, enforce install-path containment, safe deletion wrappers across `uninstall`, `prune`, and `install` (#364)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Audit hardening — `apm unpack` content scanning, SARIF/JSON/Markdown `--format`/`--output` for CI capture, `SecurityGate` policy engine, non-zero exits on critical findings (#330)
- Install output now shows resolved git ref alongside package name (e.g. `✓ owner/repo#main (a1b2c3d4)`) (#340)
- `${input:...}` variable resolution for self-defined MCP server headers and env values — by @sergio-sisternes-epam (#344)

### Changed

- Pinning hint moved from inline tip to `── Diagnostics ──` section with aggregated count (#347)
- Install ref display uses `#` separator instead of `@` for consistency with dependency syntax (#340)
- Shorthand `@alias` syntax removed from dependency strings — use the dict format `alias:` field instead (#340)

### Fixed

- File-level downloads from private repos now use OS credential helpers (macOS Keychain, `gh auth login`, Windows Credential Manager) (#332)
- Lockfile now preserves the host for GitHub Enterprise custom domains so subsequent `apm install` clones from the correct server (#338)
- MCP registry validation no longer fails on transient network errors (#337)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Native Cursor IDE integration — `apm install` deploys instructions→rules (`.mdc`), agents, skills, hooks (`hooks.json`), and MCP (`mcp.json`) to `.cursor/` (#301)
- Native OpenCode integration — `apm install` deploys agents, commands, skills, and MCP (`opencode.json`) to `.opencode/` — inspired by @timvw (#306)
- Content security scanning with `apm audit` command — `--file`, `--strip`, `--dry-run`; install-time pre-deployment gate blocks critical hidden Unicode characters (#313)
- Detect variation selectors (Glassworm attack vector), invisible math operators, bidi marks, annotation markers, and deprecated formatting in content scanning — by @raye-deng (#321, #320)
- Context-aware ZWJ detection — emoji joiners preserved by `--strip`; `--strip --dry-run` preview mode (#321)
- `TargetProfile` data layer for scalable multi-target architecture (#301)
- `CursorClientAdapter` for MCP server management in `.cursor/mcp.json` (#301)

- Clarify that `.github/` deployed files should be committed (#290)

## [0.7.8] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Diff-aware `apm install` — manifest as source of truth: removed packages, ref/version changes, and MCP config drift in `apm.yml` all self-correct on the next `apm install` without `--update` or `--force`; introduces `drift.py` with pure helper functions (#260)
- `DiagnosticCollector` for structured install diagnostics (#267)
- Detailed file-level logging to `apm unpack` command (#252)
- Astro Starlight documentation site with narrative redesign (#243)

## [0.7.3] - 2025-02-15

### Added

- **SUPPORT.md**: Added Microsoft repo-template support file directing users to GitHub Issues and Discussions for community support

### Changed

- **README Rewording**: Clarified APM as "an open-source, community-driven dependency manager" to set correct expectations under Microsoft GitHub org
- **Microsoft Open Source Compliance**: Updated LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and added Trademark Notice to README
- **Source Integrity**: Fixed source integrity for all integrators and restructured README

### Fixed

- **Install Script**: Use `grep -o` for single-line JSON extraction in install.sh
- **CI**: Fixed integration test script to handle existing venv from CI workflow

### Security

- Bumped `azure-core` 1.35.1 → 1.38.0, `aiohttp` 3.12.15 → 3.13.3, `pip` 25.2 → 26.0, `urllib3` 2.5.0 → 2.6.3

## [0.7.2] - 2025-01-23

### Added

- **Transitive Dependencies**: Full dependency resolution with `apm.lock` lockfile generation

### Fixed

- **Install Script and `apm update`**: Repaired corrupted header in install.sh. Use awk instead of sed for shell subprocess compatibility. Directed shell output to terminal for password input during update process. 

## [0.7.1] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed

- **Collection Extension Handling**: Prevent double `.collection.yml` extension when user specifies full path
- **SKILL.md Parsing**: Parse SKILL.md directly without requiring apm.yml generation
- **Git Host Errors**: Actionable error messages for unsupported Git hosts

## [0.7.0] - 2024-12-19

### Changed

- **Native Skills Support**: Skills now install to `.github/skills/` as the primary target (per [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/) standard)
- **Skills ≠ Agents**: Removed skill → agent transformation; skills and agents are now separate primitives
- **Explicit Package Types**: Added `type` field to apm.yml (`instructions`, `skill`, `hybrid`, `prompts`) for routing control
- **Skill Name Validation**: Validates and normalizes skill names per agentskills.io spec (lowercase, hyphens, 1-64 chars)
- **Claude Compatibility**: Skills also copy to `.claude/skills/` when `.claude/` folder exists

### Added

- Auto-creates `.github/` directory on install if neither `.github/` nor `.claude/` exists

## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Selective Package Install**: `apm install <package>` now only installs the specified package instead of all packages from apm.yml. Previously, installing a single package would also install unrelated packages. `apm install` (no args) continues to install all packages from the manifest.

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Claude Skills Integration**: Virtual subdirectory packages (like `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills/mcp-builder`) now correctly trigger skill generation. Previously all virtual packages were skipped, but only virtual files and collections should be skipped—subdirectory packages are complete skill packages.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **SKILL.md as first-class primitive**: meta-description of what an APM Package does for agents to read
- **Claude Skills Installation**: Install Claude Skills directly as APM Packages
- **Bidirectional Format Support**: 
  - APM packages → SKILL.md (for Claude target)
  - Claude Skills → .agent.md (for VSCode target)
- **Skills Documentation**: New `docs/skills.md` guide

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Claude Integration**: First-class support for Claude Code and Claude Desktop
  - `CLAUDE.md` generation alongside `AGENTS.md`
  - `.claude/commands/` auto-integration from installed packages
  - `SKILL.md` generation for Claude Skills format
  - Commands get `-apm` suffix (same pattern as VSCode prompts)

- **Target Auto-Detection**: Smart compilation based on project structure
  - `.github/` only → generates `AGENTS.md` + VSCode integration
  - `.claude/` only → generates `CLAUDE.md` + Claude integration  
  - Both folders → generates all formats
  - Neither folder → generates `AGENTS.md` only (universal format)

- **`target` field in apm.yml**: Persistent target configuration
  ```yaml
  target: vscode  # or claude, or all
  ```
  Applies to both `apm compile` and `apm install`

- **`--target` flag**: Override auto-detection
  ```bash
  apm compile --target claude
  apm compile --target vscode
  apm compile --target all
  ```

### Fixed

- Virtual package uninstall sync: `apm uninstall` now correctly removes only the specific virtual package's integrated files (uses `get_unique_key()` for proper path matching)

### Changed

- `apm compile` default: Changed from `--target all` to auto-detect
- README refactored with npm-style zero-friction onboarding
- Documentation reorganized with Claude integration guide

## [0.5.9] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed

- **ADO Package Commands**: `compile`, `prune`, and `deps list` now work correctly with Azure DevOps packages

## [0.5.8] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed

- **ADO Path Structure**: Azure DevOps packages now use correct 3-level paths (`org/project/repo`) throughout install, discovery, update, prune, and uninstall commands
- **Virtual Packages**: ADO collections and individual files install to correct 3-level paths
- **Prune Command**: Fixed undefined variable bug in directory cleanup

## [0.5.7] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **Azure DevOps Support**: Install packages from Azure DevOps Services and Server
  - New `ADO_APM_PAT` environment variable for ADO authentication (separate from GitHub tokens)
  - Supports `dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo` URL format
  - Works alongside GitHub and GitHub Enterprise in mixed-source projects
- **Debug Mode**: Set `APM_DEBUG=1` to see detailed authentication and URL resolution output

### Fixed

- **GitHub Enterprise Private Repos**: Fixed authentication for `git ls-remote` validation on non-github.com hosts
- **Token Selection**: Correct token now used per-platform (GitHub vs ADO) in mixed-source installations

## [0.5.6] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Enterprise GitHub host support: fallback clone now respects `GITHUB_HOST` env var instead of hardcoding github.com
- Version validation crash when YAML parses version as numeric type (e.g., `1.0` vs `"1.0"`)

### Changed

- CI/CD: Updated runner from macos-13 and macos-14 to macos-15 for both x86_64 and ARM64 builds

## [0.5.5] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- **Context Link Resolution**: Automatic markdown link resolution for `.context.md` files across installation and compilation
  - Links in prompts/agents automatically resolve to actual source locations (`apm_modules/` or `.apm/context/`)
  - Works everywhere: IDE, GitHub, all coding agents supporting AGENTS.md
  - No file copying needed—links point directly to source files

## [0.5.4] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- **Agent Integration**: Automatic sync of `.agent.md` files to `.github/agents/` with `-apm` suffix (same pattern as prompt integration)

### Fixed
- `sync_integration` URL normalization bug that caused ALL integrated files to be removed during uninstall instead of only the uninstalled package's files
  - Root cause: Metadata stored full URLs (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) while dependency list used short form (`owner/repo`)
  - Impact: Uninstalling one package would incorrectly remove prompts/agents from ALL other packages
  - Fix: Normalize both URL formats to `owner/repo` before comparison
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for multi-package scenarios
- Uninstall command now correctly removes only `apm_modules/owner/repo/` directory (not `apm_modules/owner/`)

## [0.5.3] - 2025-11-16

### Changed
- **Prompt Naming Pattern**: Migrated from `@` prefix to `-apm` suffix for integrated prompts
- **GitIgnore Pattern**: Updated from `.github/prompts/@*.prompt.md` to `.github/prompts/*-apm.prompt.md`

### Migration Notes
- **Existing Users**: Old `@`-prefixed files will not be automatically removed
- **Action Required**: Manually delete old `@*.prompt.md` files from `.github/prompts/` after upgrading

## [0.5.2] - 2025-11-14

### Added
- **Prompt Integration with GitHub** - Automatically sync downloaded prompts to `.github/prompts/` for GitHub Copilot

### Changed

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- Package FQDN support - install from any Git host using fully qualified domain names (thanks @richgo for PR #25)

### Fixed

- Package validation HTTPS URL construction for git ls-remote checks
- Virtual package orphan detection in `apm deps list` command

### Changed
- GitHub Enterprise support via `GITHUB_HOST` environment variable (thanks @richgo for PR #25)
- Build pipeline updates for macOS compatibility

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added - Virtual Packages
- **Virtual Package Support**: Install individual files directly from any repository without requiring full APM package structure
  - Individual file packages: `apm install owner/repo/path/to/file.prompt.md`
- **Collection Support**: Install curated collections of primitives from [Awesome Copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot): `apm install github/awesome-copilot/collections/collection-name`
  - Collection manifest parser for `.collection.yml` format
  - Batch download of collection items into organized `.apm/` structure
  - Integration with github/awesome-copilot collections

### Added - Runnable Prompts
- **Auto-Discovery of Prompts**: Run installed prompts without manual script configuration
  - `apm run <prompt-name>` automatically discovers and executes prompts without having to wire a script in `apm.yml`
  - Search priority: local root → .apm/prompts → .github/prompts → dependencies
  - Qualified path support: `apm run owner/repo/prompt-name` for disambiguation
  - Collision detection with helpful error messages when multiple prompts found
  - Explicit scripts in apm.yml always take precedence over auto-discovery
- **Automatic Runtime Detection**: Detects installed runtime (copilot > codex) and generates proper commands
- **Zero-Configuration Execution**: Install and run prompts immediately without apm.yml scripts section

### Changed
- Enhanced dependency resolution to support virtual package unique keys
- Improved GitHub downloader with virtual file and collection package support
- Extended `DependencyReference.parse()` to detect and validate virtual packages (3+ path segments)
- Script runner now falls back to prompt discovery when script not found in apm.yml
